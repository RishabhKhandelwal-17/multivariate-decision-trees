#   MULTIVARIATE DECISION TREES   
### Course Project for CS F464 - Machine Learning

This project is an implementation of multivariate decision trees, which make decision splits based on a linear combination of features instead of single variable (axis aligned) splits.    

Three different (and successively better) variants of the multivariate tree model are tested against traditional tree based methods and neural networks on a variety of classification tasks, the results of which are presented in the [report](https://github.com/RishabhKhandelwal-17/multivariate-decision-trees/blob/main/REPORT.pdf)
